# Factorio Modpack

This is a collection of Factorio mods I generally use in my games and run my servers with.
Created and provided as an easy method of install for people who join my servers, or simply want to use a similar set of mods.

The mods in this pack are mainly ease of life improvements and convenience. They do not drastically change the way Factorio plays.
Though there are a few mods in this pack that add additional content, mostly in terms of Storage and Transport.
